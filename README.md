- As a user I want to be able to input my own starting position, so I can see if it has one or more solutions.
- As a user I want to check if input above is valid. (no mistakes in init position).
- As a user I want to generate random starting position, so I can play a game on desired difficulty level.
- As a user I want to use suggest next move button, to help me solving sudoku, preferably at position of my discretion.
- As a user I want to input from dropdown.
- As a user I want to enter temporary pick.
- As a user I want to multiple values for one tile.
- As a user I want to toggle choose from option, so dropdown shows only valid moves. (narrows down input from 9 options to these that are legit for now).
- As a user I want to be able to enter an illegal value, with game showing it on red, but nevertheless accepting input.
- As a user I want to delete with a right click maybe.
- How do we evaluate win?
